# Supply Chain Exercise

The Supply Chain directory is a truffle project that contains the required contract, migration and test file. 

Clone this repo to your local machine.

The contract contains basic contract SupplyChain.sol (in the contracts directory) to implement an item sale. It needs to be enhanced as a full dapp to sell products for prevenance. Web/mobile interface with QR code should be implemented in such a way to avoid counterfiet of products.
It is covered with tests and should be maintained in same way.

To test your implementation start your development blockchain by running `$ truffle develop` from the terminal in the project directory. From the truffle console, compile and migrate the contracts by running `compile` and `migrate`. You can run the pre-written tests by running `test`.

If your tests do not pass, modify the contract, recompile, redeploy and retest. Iterate until all of the tests pass.

Check out the testing files to see how tests are implemented in Javascript.
